I am an addict, my drug are logical problems : they fuel me. Writing software is a simple, powerful, never ending delivery mechanism of that drug.

It's a mesmerising, hypnotic drug. In 2012 I went into a frenzy of it. Solving problems became almost my only reality at times. From working day after day I started working nights too. Then week ends.

Sleep was getting rare and difficult. My body started to complain : I got fat, my back started to be painful and ended up totally fracked up. My mood was constantly bad, I was on edge all day long. I was tired and miserable. People would keep their distances from me.

Friends and family convinced me to do something. I did, I was relieved but, still, the crash came.

They say that for those who have been through a burnout things are never the same again. It's true. I am not passionate as I was. I am glad of that.


## Shuffling

Tired, exhausted and with a bit of money aside I decided to change some things. I had time to do so, and anyway it was to painful too continue that way.

First : I slept. Then I didn't wait long. That next morning, the first of my vacation I started to run. Oh it was difficult, I could only run a couple of hundred meters.

Then I slept and eat some nice things. It was nice. I was able to refill my batteries. And I walked, and I ran. I took breaks when ever I felt the need for them. I kept that going for some months. While starting to work again for new clients.

For the last 8 months or so we have seen a lot of blog posts about walking, having a proper diet, a better work/life balance, etc …  I read a lot of those, they inspired me to continue running, and sleeping properly.

I also read about the Paleo diet. Although I don't know if the science behind it is sound it awoke the cook and food lover I had left sleeping for some years. I started to cook better food, taking time to eat properly, selecting healthier food, discarding bread, pasta, rice … Not because the Paleo diet says it's not healthy but because I knew from my own experience they were not the best for me.

Bit by bit things were getting better. What I was doing was working somehow. I wanted to understand why and see if what I was reading here and there was right.

Reading a subreddit about Paleo I stumbled once again about that famous bit : "our body did not evolve …".
It brought back a memory : my doctor (physician) told me, some time ago, as my body was closing on 95kg, that my main problem was my hyper sedentary life, in front of a computer in (almost) his own words "your body was not designed for that, it evolved around walking, not seating".

Oh ? Really ?


## Science !!
-- *slide 6*
Walter Bishop / Fringe

It sounded as common knowledge, yet, I was curious to check out the extent of it.

Turns out that up to very recently, our ancestors spend most of their time walking or running. It was necessary to survival : finding food, fleeing predators, finding new places to do that.
Along those times spikes of stress helped with decision making and learning in unknown or deadly situations.

In my readings I also found that : 
* physical activity helps with moods and brain capacities by pushing the release of several chemicals. Without those, you grow unbalanced, depressed and on edge.
* sleep not only let the body rest but allow the brain to re-order data and improve connections
* chronic stress scares tissues and damages the heart


So, indeed, my body was not meant to seat all day. Hence the problems induced to my skeleton and muscles by hyper sedentary life style.
Hence also the improvements I had seen since I started to walk and run.

My bad sleep, bad work and bad mood were also explained.

Yet, why was I so addicted to work ?


## Finding the culprits
-- *slide 2*

I asked a psychologist and a retired HR person about my experience and they pointed both to myself and the culture I was evolving in.


## Passion
-- *slide 3*

I do this work because writing code and solving problems is my crack. I not only love it, I need it and crave for it. Passion is what hooks me to coding.

It's ok to do a little rush from time to time, with friends, in a nice setting : gulping gallons of coffee and tons of pizzas.
It's ok to tinker around a problem or a device, hacking a new toy, or a prototype  to life. 
It's ok to do a hackathon either at work or with FOSS people to implement a specific set of features or crush bugs.
But those situations put us in a delicate spot. These are the coders equivalent of mountains of crack for drug addicts. Once I start, my mind quickly turns to "the zone" and I forget about the rest of the world. My passion consumes me.

My passion consumed me : I grew intensely addicted to solving the bugs, and adding features.

Yet passion alone was not the only culprit.


## Culture
-- *slide 4*

Culture is an important factor in my mess : culture from my family, culture in the industry I work in and culture in my country.

My Dad was a work addict. My mom, my brother and I didn't see much of him when my brother and I were young. Of course he provided us with everything, including the idea that work is a very important part of our lives.

In most countries and companies there is also that idea that we are supposed to work (or to be at work) a lot :
* In France you are seen as a slacker if you leave earlier than 6PM (regardless the hour at which you arrived).
* In Japan you are seen as a traitor to the company if you leave early (before the  boss).
* In Japan still, falling asleep out of exhaustion is seen as a great sign of commitment to the company
* In the startup culture, spending just few hours sleeping everyday is seen as a warrior badge and a must do.

All those, each to some degree, influenced me. And I understood that these points, added on top of my passion, locked me into a vicious circle.


## Ruins

-- *slide 5*

So I started to see a bigger picture and some reasons. My body was not a pile of rubble alone in the desert, the ruins had a complex story attached to them.

Fuelled by passion and culturally induced stress, I ignored the nature of my body and brain. This is why, after some time, I crashed.


## Where to ?

-- *slide 7*

So where did I go from there ?

The little changes I had done were proving successful. And Science explained why.
So I decided to try to find a schedule that would be even better based on my findings. A schedule that would allow me to stay passionate and work without losing sight of the big picture.


## Moving

-- *slide 9*

I kept running and seeing it was getting easier I pushed myself and from 2 or 3 km a week I doubled that. Now I am able to do 5kms twice per week.

Each run is now a boost for the rest of the week, I feel not tired but energised after each of them.


## Reading

-- *slide 10*

After all the reading I did reading is now part of my daily routine. HN, Medium and a load of articles grabbed here and there. Ruby, python, clojure, psychology, history, … everything and anything. It takes me hours but it's given me some very interesting ideas, solutions and inspirations so far.


## Writing

When I traveled I read books from several travellers and photographers. In one of them there is saying : Sylvain Tesson "how would I know what I think if I don't write it ?"

And I find it quite true. Writing ideas down, forces you to order them and trigger more thinking and ordering around.

I started writing down simple thoughts and longer posts. Publishing them or not. Writing them allowed me to get them clearer.


## Relaxing

-- *slide 12*

Having read and written, my thoughts were cleared, I became less stressed and pre-occupied. Yet sometimes it would no be enough to avoid focusing on a problem for too long. So I started to inserts walks and other musings in between work sessions to avoid becoming fixed on some problems.

Turns out that most of the time I would find the solution to my problem while walking or when I came back to the laptop.

This process is quite known in fact. Probably referred to as the Eureka moment. By switching to a totally different context, the brain relaxes, re-orders some things and EUREKA !

I used the Pomodoro technique to have a simple format to handle work and relaxing sessions.


## Making it count

-- *slide 13*

Doing all those things is intended to keep body and brain sane and working properly. Such a schedule reduced the amount of hours I can sit down and work. 

I need the breaks, walks and good nights of sleep. So I make the hours left count.

I used Pomodoro technique : it gave me a finite set of time to work, then to relax, then to work again. I slice down tasks so they can fit one or half a pomodoro. Then I define a group of tasks to be done and group them. Those are the basis for my topic branches for example.

I learned and accepted to suck at some things. Some people love to do some things that I hate : so I pass the ball to them if I can. If I can't then I try to take the proper time to learn a fix or get help. It's ok.

-- automation
http://www.flickr.com/photos/studiobeeldruis/2662703996/ by Arnoooo

Automation is key. I spent some pomodoros defining what can be automated, what are the tools I could use or write to automate things.


With all this I end with a leaner way to work, and those few hours of work got awesome, rewarding hours. Instead of spending 10 hours a day working without a plan, on a rush, adding bugs instead of features, eating junk food I was power walking through properly though set of features and steps.

According to some studies the brain cannot focus for more than 4 to 6 hours per day. Yes you heard right : working more than that and avoiding walks, sleep and relaxing time is plain suicidal on the medium and long run. Our bodies are not designed for that. PERIOD.

I now think that the brain cannot focus for more than 4 to 6 hours per day (and studies have shown confirmed it).

I know that even if work I less, have breaks, proper sleep, proper food and diverse readings and talks I do better work.

You might laugh and think "uhuhu what a slacker, I do 60 hours a week" and I'll tell you "great, I hope your body can really do this and that you won't end up like me". Yet I still think that you probably will and that you work in a unpredictable way, with poor scheduling. But if it works for you : GREAT !

Here are the basics of what I did :

* walk a bit everyday (30 min) (and then started to run)
* set a timer to have regular breaks
* organise and schedule work around those break
* eat nice food
* keep a proper set of hours to sleep
* take time to see friends, family, people and talk about something else than work


This is not a recipe, these are not rules. This is just a story about how I decided to change my way of doing things and the reasons behind this change. If it can avoid one of you the trouble of crashing psychologically or physically it would be worth it.

Check your body, check your life : are they healthy ? Do you think you can go long like this ?

Check the science, check how others do. Does it make sense to you ? Would it benefit you ?
