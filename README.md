Hello, my name is Thomas, I am currently in between jobs and contracts and I am going to tell you a story about our generation.

I believe that while running after a technical Graal (get a super paid gig, found the new github, or heroku)  we forgot some crucial points about our biology and put ourselves in peril.

Why do I believe this ? Because I have crashed and I have looked into a bit of science to understand why it happened.

## I was a work addict

I am the son of an IT professional who started to work with computers when they were eating cardboard and shitting paper. When his career ended the first iPad was about to be announced.

As most of kids in a similar situation I grew up in front of computers : Apple Macintosh, random 286, 386 and .. pentium units.

Through early exposure to internet, GNU/linux and php I grew intensely addicted to FOSS, its communities and projects.
Around 2002, a student in an engineering school near Paris, I grew tired of C++ and Php when I heard about languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby. I tried several ones but Ruby ended up on top.

When a friend told me to check out RubyOnRails circa 2005 I was ecstatic : it was as if someone heard my prayers. It was all the beauty of Ruby, for the web, with a clear set rules to build applications with it.

I was then employed by a consulting company. I pushed the management people to grab the Rails opportunity so they asked me to write an article and do a talk about Rails. Yet they would not accept to sell Rails based consultancy to their clients.

Instead I spent 14 months doing shell scripting for different clients. For one I had to accept to work on 3000 lines of korn shell with two other developers, without any versioning tool beside FTP. No tests, no niceties beside AWK and SED. Everyday was a torture. I was tired, pressured and angry. I left to save my self.

After some adventures, my hunger for code pushed me to come back to it. It felt good, and Ruby by then was in full swing (or so) in France. A friend asked to join forces for a project, I happily did.

It felt great.

To us, developers, logical problems are like crack. We are passionate about them and it literally fuels us. Writing software is one delivery method for this crack.

From part time, I ended working full time for the client. I was working day after day to solve problems, build features. I was back in the game, back in the zone.

Then I started to work nights too. And week ends.

"I needed to finish that feature"

"I needed to fix that bug"

All at the same time.

?

I was sleeping less and less. My back fracked up at some point. I was highly irritable. I felt miserable.

Several times I trashed things around me. People would stay away from me as if I was exuding some sort of red, angry aura.

Talking with some friends and family I decided to stop that adventure.
It took me some courage and time. But I could not keep going. Still, I crashed.


They say that for those who have been through a burnout things are never the same again. It's true. I am not passionate as I was. But I am glad.

This allowed me to look into the reasons why I crashed, what happened, and how I could avoid such things in the future ?


## Finding the culprits
-- *slide 2*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/dynamosquito/4265771518/ by dynamosquito

When I sat down and started to look back at what happened I quickly found two usual suspects :
* passion : I am a passionate developer, I love coding, that passion pushed me in those long nights and days, forgetting to eat, sleep, move
* culture : I was raised by a work addict, companies I worked for and countries I lived in glorify long hours, I felt compelled to follow and stay in the group


## Passion
-- *slide 3*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/8525214@N06/3236824478 by antony chammond

What is obvious to most people outside our little world is the fact that we, developers, especially in the Python, Ruby, (insert other alternate language) world, are passionate.

We do this work because writing code and solving problems is our crack. We not only love it, we need it and crave it. Passion is what hooks us to coding, it's  what make us closer to craftsmen than simple chain coders pissing lines of code.
Yet it can also turn into a deadly poison when stress and some cultural settings are added to it.

It's ok to do a little rush from time to time, with friends, in a nice setting : gulping gallons of coffee and tons of pizzas.
It's ok to tinker around a problem or a device, hacking a new toy, or a prototype  to life. 
It's ok to do a hackathon either at work or with FOSS people to implement a specific set of features or crush bugs.
But those situation put us in a delicate spot. These are coders equivalent of mountains of crack, table after table of pizzas, sushi rolls and belgian beers. Once we start, our mind quickly turns to "the zone" and we forget about the rest of the world. Our passion consumes us.

This what happened to me. I grew intensely addicted to solving the bugs, and adding features.
That passion did fuel that step, but it's probably culture that threw me under the train.


## Culture
-- *slide 4*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/40701092@N08/3839575697/ by Karl Raats

Culture is indeed an important factor in my mess and in the mess of many of us. It can be culture from your family, culture from your company and culture from your country.

My Dad was a work addict. My mom, my brother and I didn't see much of him when my brother and I were young. Of course he provided us with everything, including the idea that work is a very important part of our lives.

In most countries and companies there is also that idea that we are supposed to work (or to be at work) a lot :
* In France you are seen as a slacker if you leave earlier than 6PM (regardless the hour at which you arrived).
* In Japan you are seen as a traitor to the company if you leave early (before the  boss).
* In the startup culture, spending just few hours sleeping everyday is seen as a warrior badge and a must do.

Using those culture triggers on top of passion leads to terrible consequences if one is unbalanced.

My clients were pushy, they would ask me for bug fixes and features and disregard my advice. Just like Dune's spice, the code had to flow.

Feeling honour bound, unable to recognise failure, or simply unwilling to stand up and say no, I kept going.

What's important here is to recognise that I have as much responsibility as my clients here. I could have stood up at any moment, they could have seen the pattern too.
This is where there is a risk of Stockholm's syndrome.

This mix of passion, education, startup culture, country culture is a terrible poison for the ones who don't have the experience or knowledge of their limits. Or the ones who don't have a mentor looking after them spotting the symptoms of overwork and kicking them out of work some days.


## Ruins

-- *slide 5*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/jixxer/4507232875 by Kristofer Williams

At some point I decided I could not go on and wanted to do things in another way. Let's sum up what I ended with :

* broken back (at some point I was stuck in a bed for 2 weeks)
* super angry (I would just be a ball of anger from morning to evening)
* very bad sleep (could not sleep more than a couple of hours)
* super inefficient (I would spend morning fixing the crappy work I did the night before)
* super lagged on technology
* fat (98kg at some point)

I knew kind of how it happened : fuelled by passion and (culturally induced) stress I crashed.
Still the precise mechanics or stepping stones of the crash were not clear. So I turned to science : psychology, biology, medicine, neurology, ...


## Science !!
-- *slide 6*
Walter Bishop / Fringe

Some millenniums ago, our great-great-… grand parents were living in trees eating fruits and what ever could be found in the branches or immediate proximity of the trunks.
Then the weather patterns changed and the equatorial regions grew drier. Trees started to get scarcer and our ancestors had to walk on the ground in between trees for more and more time.
We were not the only ones evolving, soon predators would use the change in landscape to hunt. All this selected individuals who were able to move faster, over longer distances.
This is when and why our ancestors became bipeds. Bipedal walk is simpler, and more energy efficient. You can walk further (up to 20km/day), see further too (important strategic advantage in plains).

Migrations, and scarcer food also pushed for more changes. As the population moved around the landscape changed and obstacles appeared (rivers, lakes, seas, mountains). Solving new problems was a daily thing probably for some time : better weaponry, better protection against weather, fire making, etc … It was probably stressful at some point but only in spikes : at hunting time, at night when a lion or wolf would be heard in the distance.

* individuals who could remember how to do things would have a better chance to survive
* individuals who could adapt something their remembered would have a better chance to survive
* individuals who would be adventurous and tests things would have better chances to discover new ways of hunting, making fire etc .. they learned by trials and failures (like we do)
* languages and symbols where developed to share and reuse those experiences and knowledge, sharing would improve chances of survival for the group, especially our offspring

-- http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5628331511 by Nick Bramhall

Yet, all this doesn't happen only at day time, night time is very important.

As the night would stop our ancestors from walking or hunting they would stop by some sort of camp to rest.
During those 8 hours or so of blackness their bodies would use the absorbed food and water to refill local muscles reserves. Evacuate waste to proper facilities, etc …
Meanwhile the brain would process what it had absorbed during the day : new landscapes, new sounds, new techniques. Memory was shuffled and filed around by clever reconnections of the neurones.
This process has not changed either. It's still happening every time we sleep. MRI and brain imagery light up brightly at sleep time. Replaying scenarios and memories from the last hours and days to improve response time the next time similar things happen. This process could define the difference between ending alive or dead on a hunt.

The change in the landscape forced our ancestors to become more active physically, and more clever. The *homo sapiens sapiens* body and brain were carved by physical activity through survival needs.

To put it simply :
* our body has evolved through daily physical activity (12 miles/ 20 km per day !)
* our brain has evolved through diverse problem solving needs
* our brain has evolved through sleep to improve or maintain its skills and speed


## Where to ?

-- *slide 7*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/helga/4598074787 by  Helga Weber

So where do we go from here ?

We have seen that a *Homo sapiens sapiens* body needs physical activity, sleep and rare spikes of stress.
Yet as we recall, this was totally what I was not doing : I was seating in front of my computer for 10 hours or more, sleeping 3 to 5 hours and constantly under stress.

What happens to a machine that you don't use as it was designed to ? It stop working properly. No surprise.

I had literally no choice : going further in the same direction would mean more trouble : psychological and physical problems, and an early death. I am not joking.

So what did I do ?


## Shuffling

-- *slide 8*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/generated/6313491064 by jared

The first thing I did was to have a nice break and change my habits : shuffling my cards around. Breaking the vicious circle and starting anew. I took some weeks of rest, I went to Berlin, and some nice 5 stars hotel, I started running ...

## Moving

-- *slide 9*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/3049152556 by Ed yourdon

Our body was designed by and around physical activity. So we need to move. There is not an activity better than another, a mix of diverse activities is probably better. Yet what is important is to move, a least a little bit, everyday.

Having no physical activity will induce loss of general muscle mass. In my case it was mainly around the back ending up in mild damages to some of my vertebras.

Physical activity also helps with moods and brain capacities by pushing the release of several chemicals. Without those, you grow unbalanced, depressed and on edge.

I started walking daily, small walks first, then I started running. Hundreds of meters first, kilometres now. Each run is a boost for the rest of the week, I feel not tired but energised after each of them.


## Reading

-- *slide 10*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/chanc/2558304478 by Christopher Chan

I started to read blogs, articles and books about diverse topics when I felt down or unable to focus. I though that, instead of just browsing 9gag or 4chan I should still put that time to good use by reading "real" stuff.

Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, is known to be reading a lot, allowing him to get the bigger picture of things faster that anyone else. That lead him to push for what would become AWS some years ago. Long before "the cloud" was even a thing.

Now reading is part of my daily routine. HN, Medium and a load of articles grabbed here and there. Ruby, python, clojure, psychology, history, … everything and anything. It takes me hours but it's given me some very interesting ideas, solutions and inspirations so far. Including this talk.


## Writing

-- *slide 11*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/walker_ep/3086674683/ by e_walk

(Petit traité sur l'immensité du monde, Sylvain Tesson, 978-2266167598)

When I traveled I read books from several travellers and photographers. In one of them there is saying : Sylvain Tesson "how would I know what I think if I don't write it ?"

And I find it quite true. Writing ideas down, forces you to order them and trigger more thinking and ordering around. Thoughts get clearer as if talking with another person responding back to you. That reformulation is crucial to problem solving in the end.

I started writing down shots of thoughts and longer articles. Publishing them or not. Writing them allowed me to get them clearer.


## Relaxing

-- *slide 12*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/3376506512 by stuck in customs

Having read and written my thoughts were cleared, I became less stressed and pre-occupied. I started to inserts walks and other musings in between work sessions to avoid becoming fixed on some problems.

This process is quite known in fact. Probably referred to as the Eureka moment. By switching to a totally different context, the brain relaxes, re-orders some things and EUREKA !

Walks, readings, or simple coffee breaks helps to relax along the day. Pomodoro technique gives a nice format to handle work and relaxing sessions.

Relaxing is important to avoid chronic stress. Chronic stress is a killer : it scars tissues and damages the heart, it is also one of the prime suspect for several diseases of our era.


## Making it count

-- *slide 13*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/1063556470/ by The US Army

Doing all those things are intended to keep your body and brain sane and working properly. Such a schedule will reduce the amount of hours you can sit down and work. GOOD.

Because we need to take those walks, those breaks, those naps and nights of sleep. We need to work less. or rather we can't pretend to work more than a very little couple of hours.

So I just had to make those hours count :
* I got better at organising my workload : I sliced tasks to very little items
* I gave away tasks I don't like or I am not good at
* I automated all the stupid repetitive tasks I did everyday.

-- pomodoro

http://www.pomodorotechnique.com

I used Pomodoro technique : it gave me a finite set of time to work, then to relax, then to work again. I sliced down tasks so they could fit one or half a pomodoro. Then I defined a group of tasks to be done and grouped them. These were the basis for my topic branches or a specific set of tasks to perform.

-- sucking at things / hAlp
http://www.flickr.com/photos/dirigentens/4663779089/ by Dirigentens

I learned and accepted to suck at some things. Some people love to do some things that I hate : so I pass the ball to them if I can. If I can't then I try to take the proper time to learn a fix or get help. It's ok.

-- automation
http://www.flickr.com/photos/studiobeeldruis/2662703996/ by Arnoooo

Automation is key. I spent some pomodoros defining what can be automated, what are the tools I could use or write to automate things.

I ended with a leaner way to work, and those few hours of work got awesome, rewarding hours. Instead of spending 10 hours a day working without a plan, on a rush, adding bugs instead of features, eating junk food I was power walking through properly through set of features and steps.


## .
-- *slide 14*
http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonathankosread/6250327997/ by Jonathan Kos-Read

According to some studies the brain cannot focus for more than 4 to 6 hours per day. Yes you heard right : working more than that and avoiding walks, sleep and relaxing time is plain suicidal on the medium and long run. Our bodies are not designed for that. PERIOD.

You might laugh and think "uhuhu what a slacker, I do 60 hours a week" and I'll tell you "great, I hope your body can really do this and that you won't end up like me". Yet I still think that you probably will and that you work in a unpredictable way, with poor scheduling. But if it works for you : GREAT !

Over the course of those last 18 months I have tried different things and learned a lot. I have lost close to 10 kgs, and I am now able to run 5kms twice a week. My thoughts are clearer and I am able to schedule and respect sets of features.
The quantity of hours worked have reduced but the quality have gone up up up.
I have also improved my self respect, social capacities and mood. Hell, I am giving talks to tens of people !

Here is what I did :

* walk a bit everyday (30 min)
* set a timer to have regular breaks
* organise and schedule work around those break
* eat nice food
* keep a proper set of hours to sleep
* take time to see friends, family, people and talk about something else than work


This is not a recipe, these are not rules. This is just a story about how I decided to change my way of doing things and the reasons behind this change. If it can avoid one of you the trouble of crashing psychologically or physically it would be worth it.

Check your body, check your life : are they healthy ? Do you think you can go long like this ?

Check the science, check how others do. Does it make sense to you ? Would it benefit you ?
